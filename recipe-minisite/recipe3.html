       <div id="list3">
        <p>For Peach Filling:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>10 cups (around 4 pounds) peeled chopped fresh peaches (1- to 1.5-inch chunks)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For Biscuit Topping:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold and cubed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup buttermilk, cold</li>
            <li>egg wash: 1 large egg beaten with 1 Tablespoon milk or buttermilk</li>
            <li>optional: 2 Tablespoons granulated sugar mixed with 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Lightly grease a 9×13-inch baking pan. Any 3- to 4-quart baking dish works.</li>
            <li>For the filling: Mix all of the filling ingredients together in a large bowl, then spread into the baking pan. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside as you prepare the topping. Keep the oven on.</li>
            <li>For the topping: Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Using a pastry cutter or 2 forks, cut in the cold butter until the mixture resembles coarse pea-sized crumbles. You could also pulse in a food processor. Pour in the buttermilk, and gently mix until evenly combined. The dough should be slightly sticky once completely combined, but if it’s too dry, add 1 more Tablespoon of buttermilk.</li>
            <li>Assemble the cobbler: Take handfuls of dough and use your hands to gently flatten out into patties. Place dough all over the top of the warm peach filling. There’s no special trick to this—just flatten the dough in sections and cover most of the peaches.</li>
            <li>Brush the top of the biscuit dough with egg wash, then sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar, if using.</li>
            <li>ake for 40–50 minutes, or until the biscuit topping is golden brown and peach filling is bubbling around the edges. To test for doneness, stick a toothpick into the biscuit topping; if it comes out clean, it’s done.</li>
            <li>Remove cobbler from the oven, and set the pan on a cooling rack. Cool for 5 minutes before serving. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.</li>
            <li>Cover and store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
