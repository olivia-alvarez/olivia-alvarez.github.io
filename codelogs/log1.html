	<h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>
    
    <h2>What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?</h2>
    <p>Semantic tags allow the coder or viewer the ability to accurately see content for its meaning and why it was placed in its location. Semantic tags are placed to organize script content and the tags directly relate to the content within them. 
        For example, a <p> tag suggests that a paragraph will be held within this HTML element. 
        Non-semantic tags do not tell the viewer anything about its content. Non-semantic tags are put in place to assist in layout or content structure. Non-semantic tags should be used sparingly as they are commonly used to group content and apply styles through CSS. 
        For example, a <div> tag would serve as a generic container for other elements. </p>
    
    <h2>What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags?</h2>
    <p>There are many benefits to using semantic tags. The organization and structure of a website is put together more effectively by using HTML semantic tags. 
        Semantic keywords can have an impact on where websites are placed when searching on a search engine, leading to better search engine optimisation. Another benefit of appropriately used semantic tags is accessibility. 
        Semantic tags can allow those with disabilities to access and navigate websites and webpages. Accessibility capabilities result in equitable digital environments which can promote more traffic to your website and/or webpages. 
        Accessibility is beneficial overall for all parties involved.</p>
