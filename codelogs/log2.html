        Code Log 2: CSS Measuring Units
    </h1>

    <h2>
        The difference between absolute and relative CSS length units:
    </h2>
    <p>
        There are two types of length units in CSS, absolute and relative. Absolute length units are fixed, meaning they
        are constant and will not change their value based on circumstances like the size of a parent element.
        Absolute length units are not recommended for screen layouts due to the varying screen sizes. Absolute length
        units can however be used for mediums like print layouts because their output is known.
        Relative length units are relative to another length property. Relative length units are crucial for creating
        responsive and accessible web designs that respond to different screen sizes and user preferences.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Absolute Lengths:
    </h2>
    <p>
        px: pixels, 1 px = 1/96th of 1 in, pixels can be used to communicate properties such as font-size, for example
        (font-size:12px;)
    </p>
    <p>
        pt: points, 1 pt = 1/72nd of 1 in, points can also be used to communicate font-size, for example
        (font-size:12pt;)
    </p>
    <h2>
        Relative Lengths:
    </h2>
    <p>
        em: a scalable unit of measurement relative to the font size of the element, for example (2em means 2 times the
        size of the current font)
    </p>
    <p>
        rem: a unit of measurement relative to the font size of the root element, rem = "root em"
    </p>
    <p>
        vmin: viewport minimum, used to define sizes based on the smaller dimension, either width or height, of the
        browser window, for example (in portrait orientation the vmin would be relative to the width of the viewport as
        it is smaller than the length)
    </p>
    <p>
        vmax: viewport maximum, relative to the viewport's larger dimension, for example (in portrait orientation the
        vmax would be relative to the length of the viewport as it is larger than the width)
    </p>
